This is largely a list of things I haven't sorted out how to automate yet.

1. Swap command and control positions (System > Keyboard > Modifier Keys)
2. Add 10 Virtual Desktops
3. Disable switch space animations (System > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion)
4. For some reason in order to get Kitty to open properly, had to launch it for the first time via `open -a /Applications/kitty.app`.
5. Switch keyboard source to "Unicode Hex Input". This will get rid of the option + character key combo from outputting special characters on MacOS.
6. Install Yabai [link](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai-(latest-release)#macos-big-sur---automatically-load-scripting-addition-on-startup)
7. Install RDM (https://github.com/usr-sse2/RDM/releases). Note - 125% on Ultrawide is 2752X1152 and 120% is 2867X1200
8. Disable automatically re-arrange spaces
9. Bind shortcuts for Virtual Spaces
