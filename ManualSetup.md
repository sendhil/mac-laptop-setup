This is largely a list of things I haven't sorted out how to automate yet.

- Disable switch space animations (System > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion)
- For some reason in order to get Kitty to open properly, had to launch it for the first time via `open -a /Applications/kitty.app`.
- Switch keyboard source to "Unicode Hex Input". This will get rid of the option + character key combo from outputting special characters on MacOS.
- Disable automatically re-arrange spaces
- Setup Alfred
- Setup Neovim
- Setup Aerospace
- Setup iTerm2
- Setup Obsidian
- Setup Ice
- Disable click wallpaper to reveal desktop (System > Desktop & Dock > Desktop & Stage Manager)
- Install Endel
